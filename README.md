# Clausewise
ClauseWise is an AI-powered Contract Intelligence Platform designed to help individuals and small businesses understand legal contracts and identify potential risks before signing.

Many SMEs struggle with complex legal language, hidden penalty clauses, unlimited liabilities, and unfavorable jurisdiction terms. ClauseWise addresses this problem by allowing users to upload contracts (PDF or TXT) and automatically performing:

Risk clause detection (penalty, liability, arbitration, jurisdiction, etc.)

Risk scoring (0–100) with Low/Medium/High classification

Highlighting of risky terms directly in the contract text

Category-wise risk analysis (Legal, Financial, Operational)

Actionable recommendations to improve contract safety

Downloadable PDF risk reports

Interactive dashboard with risk trends and distributions

Upload history management with search, delete, and CSV export

The platform also provides a visual dashboard to track contract risk over time and maintains an audit trail of analyzed documents.

ClauseWise demonstrates an end-to-end LegalTech workflow including document ingestion, automated analysis, explainable insights, reporting, and history management.
