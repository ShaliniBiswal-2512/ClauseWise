# ClauseWise

ClauseWise is an AI-powered Contract Intelligence Platform designed to help individuals and small businesses understand legal contracts and identify potential risks before signing.

Risk clause detection (penalty, liability, arbitration, jurisdiction, etc.)

Risk scoring (0–100) with Low / Medium / High classification

Highlighting of risky terms directly in the contract text

Category-wise risk analysis (Legal, Financial, Operational)

Actionable recommendations to improve contract safety

Downloadable PDF risk reports

Interactive dashboard with risk trends and distributions

Upload history management with search, delete, and CSV export

The platform also provides a visual dashboard to track contract risk over time and maintains an audit trail of analyzed documents.
